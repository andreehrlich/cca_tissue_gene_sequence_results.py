######  	 ABOUT THIS SCRIPY 	    #
#####################################
# This script will read the results of sequenced barcodes of tissue
# so they can easily be searched and organized by the scientist.
# URL to retreive gene sequencing data for CCA tissue: https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaCancerDetails.jsp?diseaseType=CHOL&diseaseName=Cholangiocarcinoma
#####################################
######  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:		#
#####################################
## py file must be in same folder as the topmost layer of the gene sequence folder.
## go to Tools > Build, or press cmd + B to run the script.
# This script just barcodes RNA from the link above. it should be able to intepret other sets of data from the site.
# ideally this will be a command line tool... http://www.diveintopython.net/scripts_and_streams/command_line_arguments.html
